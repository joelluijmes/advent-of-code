# Advent of Code

My hobby project for solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

## 2025

Currently working on 2025. This year runs in its own venv to keep it isolated from 2020 and future years.

## 2020

Partial implementation - made it through 11 days before quitting. Some days are even solved with BigQuery!

## Other Years

I worked on other years too, but couldn't find those attempts anymore. Typically I try out a new language each year (such as Go and Rust). Guess I didn't keep those around.
